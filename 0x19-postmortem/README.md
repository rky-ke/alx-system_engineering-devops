# Web Stack Outage - README

## Overview

This repository contains information about a recent web stack outage incident that occurred on January 24, 2024. The purpose of this README is to provide a concise summary of the incident, its impact, root cause, timeline, resolution, and the corrective and preventative measures taken to address the issue.

## Incident Summary

**Duration:**
- *Start Time:* January 24, 2024, 03:45 AM (UTC)
- *End Time:* January 24, 2024, 05:30 AM (UTC)

**Impact:**
- The outage affected the core authentication service, impacting approximately 25% of users who were unable to log in or access their accounts.

**Root Cause:**
- Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an aggressive rate limiting on authentication requests, causing a bottleneck in the authentication process.

## Timeline

- *03:45 AM (UTC):* Monitoring alerts detected a spike in failed authentication attempts.
  
- *03:50 AM (UTC):* Initial investigation focused on authentication service logs, assuming a possible DDoS attack.

- *04:05 AM (UTC):* Incident escalated to the Network Operations team for further investigation.

- *04:20 AM (UTC):* Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings identified as the root cause.

- *04:30 AM (UTC):* Load balancer settings adjusted to alleviate rate limiting, and services were gradually restored.

- *05:30 AM (UTC):* Full service recovery confirmed. Incident closed.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
- Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused aggressive rate limiting on authentication requests.

**Resolution:**
- Load balancer settings adjusted to reasonable values, allowing authentication requests to flow smoothly and restoring normal service operation.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Automated Configuration Checks:** Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations to detect anomalies in real-time.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Strengthen monitoring on authentication services for early detection of unusual patterns.
3. **Incident Response Training:** Conduct additional training for the operations team to improve incident response time and efficiency.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations for consistency and accuracy.
2. **Documentation Update:** Update documentation regarding load balancer settings to prevent similar misconfigurations.
3. **Regular Simulation Exercises:** Schedule regular simulation exercises to train teams on responding to various incidents.

## Conclusion

This incident postmortem underscores the importance of meticulous configuration management, proactive monitoring, and ongoing training for incident response. The measures outlined here aim to strengthen the system's resilience and reduce the likelihood of similar outages in the future.
